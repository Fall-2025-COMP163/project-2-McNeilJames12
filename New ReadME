Project Description:

This project demonstrates core OOP concepts—inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, and composition—by creating a simple fantasy character system.
Three player classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue) inherit from a shared Player class, which itself inherits from the base Character class.
A separate Weapon class is included to show composition.
A provided SimpleBattle system is used to test interactions between characters.



Bonus Creative Features:

Added enhanced combat messages for immersion (critical hit effects, spell dialogue).
Improved stat displays for readability.
Included weapon objects even though they are not required in battle (extra demonstration of composition).


AI Usage:

None
